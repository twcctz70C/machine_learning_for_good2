Module 0: Introduction to the course
======

Welcome to the introductory module for this course on machine learning! Here we begin with the basics - data science best practices, how to use Python and pandas, and how to pull the Kiva data using their API. 

Topic overview
----

In these notebooks we have some basic examples of how to use Python, and in particular the pandas library. We have also provided our code to use the Kiva API to pull data.

If you're using Python for the first time, great! There are [installation instructions for the Anaconda environment](python_installation_instructions.md), which includes Python and many popular libraries.

If familiar with coding but not Python, it may be useful to see some of the Python syntax. Or if familiar with pandas already, these notebooks may be skipped. The notebook on using the Kiva API does not need to be run as the dataframe has been saved in the [data](../data/) folder, but is provided to see how the data was pulled.
