Our primary source of textual data is the descriptive texts that borrowers submit for a loan request and are posted publicly on the Kiva website. Kiva is unique in that often, borrowers do not write descriptive requests for themselves, but fill out a questionnaire to Kiva's team of volunteer translators. We try to leverage this body of text (also called a *\"corpus\"*) to see if we can see any patterns in how an individual translator writes a description.\n",

We know, just in our daily knoweldge of English names, that names that end in -a are likely to be female, and names that end in -o are likely to be male (for example, Jenna and Pablo). Since we have both the gender data and the name data for the borrowers, let's use borrowers' data to train a classifier model that can predict the gender from a name! Then, we will apply this model to the translators names to predict their genders. \n",
