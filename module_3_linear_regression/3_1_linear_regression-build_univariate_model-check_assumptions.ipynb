This is consistent with our earlier explanatory analysis. How do we know however, whether this is a significant result?\n",

A 95% confidence interval has a 0.95 probability of containing the population mean. 95% of the population distribution is contained in the confidence interval.\" [Read more here.](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standard-error.asp) The p-value is an indicator of where we fall in the confidence interval.
