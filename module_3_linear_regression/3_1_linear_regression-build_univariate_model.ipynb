    "    \n",
    "Let's state the results. Regardless of the number of borrowers, the predicted loan amount is 384 dollars. However, with the every additional borrower, the loan amount increases by 50 dollars. This is consistent with our earlier explanatory analysis. How do we know however, whether this is a significant result?\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a sufficient amount of confidence in this conclusion because the **p-value** is reported to be 0.000. In technical terms, the p-value is **the probability of getting results as extreme as the ones observed given no correlation. **\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistics, we want our results to fall within the 95% confidence interval, or the p-value to be <= 0.05. This means, \"[i]f repeated samples were taken and the 95% confidence interval was computed for each sample, 95% of the intervals would contain the population mean. A 95% confidence interval has a 0.95 probability of containing the population mean. 95% of the population distribution is contained in the confidence interval.\" [Read more here.](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standard-error.asp) The p-value is an indicator of where we fall in the confidence interval. In English, small p-value (<= 0.05) indicates strong evidence that the coefficient is different than 0. \n",

    "This is a relatively simplified explanation of p-values. Don't worry if it's not immediately intuitive - [not even professional statisticians can easily explain this concept.](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/not-even-scientists-can-easily-explain-p-values/) To get a deeper understanding, we recommend grabbing the nearest textbook on statistics to review! \n",

To recap lessons from Module 2, the Adjusted R Squared is an explanation of how much of the outcome feature can be explained by the model's explanatory features. This low Adj R Squared suggests that the predictive value of borrower_count alone is pretty low - it cannot be used as the single feature to predict loan_amount. \n",
