Module 0: Introduction to the course
======

Welcome to the introductory module for this course on machine learning! 

Here we begin with the fundamentals: installing Python, setting up your environment, data science best practices, and how to use Python and Pandas.

------
Setup
-----

If you're using Python for the first time, great! There are [installation instructions for the Anaconda environment](python_installation_instructions.md).

After you install Python, we need to setup our environment for the course. We have included a setup script. Try running it at the command line `$ sh setup.sh`. It will take a while to download and install all of the libraries we'll be using. If that doesn't make sense or doesn't work for you, you can always just run the course in your browser [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/DeltaAnalytics/machine_learning_for_good/master).

Useful Things to Know
-----

In these notebooks we have some basic examples of how to use Python üêç, and in particular the Pandas üêº library. 

If familiar with coding but not Python, it may be useful to see some of the Python syntax. Or if familiar with Pandas already, these notebooks may be skipped.
