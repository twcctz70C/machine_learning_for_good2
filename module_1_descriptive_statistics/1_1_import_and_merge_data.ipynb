For example, in the cell below we tell Jupyter to output the results of all commands in a cell (the default is only to output the results of the last command). For more interesting and incredibly useful Jupyter tricks take a look at [this](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tips-tricks-shortcuts/) blog post. Using Jupyter shortcuts will help you work faster.

We show the top 10 loan partners by size, you can see that the top loan partner '133' has been involved in 28,560 loans.
