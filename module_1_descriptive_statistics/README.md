Module 1: Introduction to Exploratory Analysis
=====

Welcome to first module! In this module, we start exploring our [Kiva](https://www.kiva.org/) dataset.

### Goals

- Learn how to merge and manipulate datasets using pandas in Python
- Perform data checking and cleaning
- Understand the data using descriptive statistics and graphs

Recap
-----
Before getting started on this module, you should have worked your way through and understood the introductory module:

- **Module 0: Introduction**
You should now be able to use python with several of the crucial libraries. You should be familiar with the Kiva loan dataset and have a clear understanding of data science best practices.

Topic overview
----

The goal of exploratory analysis is to summarize the main characteristics of a data set, with the belief that it may lead to new hypotheses that inform algorithm choice and experimentation. Exploratory analysis happens before formal modeling commences, and is extremely important for helping inform or sharpen your hypothesis.

Module structure
----

1. In this module, we compile the dataset from the loan data previously pulled. 
2. We explore some of the variables to clean up types and remove missing values. 
3. We perform checks on the number of observations and examine descriptive statistics.
4. We use the seaborn package to visualize some of the key variables.
