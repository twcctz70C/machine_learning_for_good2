# MODULE NAME
================================================================================

Welcome to module [INSERT NUMBER HERE] of the introductory course to data for good where we will be exploring [INSERT NAME] - [INSERT SMALL BLURB]
## Recap
Before getting started on this module, you should have worked your way through and understood the following modules:
**ONLY KEEP MODULES LEADING UP TO THE PRESENT MODULE**
- **Module 0: Introduction**
You should now be able to use python with several of the crucial libraries. You should be familiar with the kiva loan dataset and have a clear understanding of data science best practices.
- **Module 1: Descriptive Statistics**
Here, you should have manipulated datasets using pandas in Python and evaluated the dataset using descriptive statistics. Here you also started exploring data to inform and formulate your data science hypotheses.
- **Module 2: Feature Engineering**
Next, you used domain knowledge and data understanding to handle outliers and create features for your data science investigation.
- **Module 3: Linear Regression**
For your first machine learning algorithm, you should have explored linear regression. From this you should be able to interpret the model, verify and check assumption and evaluate it's performance.
- **Module 4: Decision Trees and Random Forests**
Here you should experimented with the non-parametric decision trees and improved their performance by parameter selection and more advanced models such bagged decision trees and random forests.

#### Data Requirements
In order to continue with this module you will need to use the following datasets:
- [INSER DATASET] which was created during Module 2.
