__How can we use data for social impact?__

Data is powerful. We believe that anyone can harness that power for change.

In this introductory course, students will learn the foundational theory and the necessary coding skills to translate data into actionable insights. Students will learn the latest machine learning tools and algorithms. 

Data science is a highly interdisciplinary practice: demanding critical thinking, understanding of statistics, and technical coding ability. Irresponsible application of powerful algorithms or an inadequate exploration of underlying assumptions can lead to spurious results. In this course, we emphasize the fundamentals of proper data science and expose students to what is possible using sophisticated machine learning methods. 

Each of the modules is hands-on, project-based, using real world data from [KIVA](https://www.kiva.org/), a non-profit that connects people through lending to alleviate poverty. 

[Delta Analytics](http://www.deltanalytics.org/) is a 501(c)3 Bay Area non-profit dedicated to bringing rigorous data science to problem-solving, effecting change in nonprofits and the public sector, and making data science an accessible and democratic resource for anyone with the same mission. 

Overview
----

Topics covered in this course include: data cleaning, supervised machine learning, and unsupervised machine learning.

The slides that cover the theory of the topic are available [here](http://www.deltanalytics.org/curriculum.html). We present theory alongside real-life data science examples will open doors to novices and professionals alike to harness the power of data for good. 

Course outcomes 
----

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

1. Explain the fundamental statistical and machine learning algorithms that underlying common data science methods.
1. Write code to clean, process, analyze, and visualize real-world data.
1. Be able to communicate with other data scientists using technical terms.

Our students
----

The course is intended for any and all individuals interested in harnessing data towards solving problems in their communities. Minimal prior coding or mathematical/statistical experience is expected. Computer proficiency is necessary.
