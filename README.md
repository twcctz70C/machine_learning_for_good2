# Introduction to Data Science for Social Good

How can we use data for social impact? In this introductory course, students learn foundational theory and the coding skills necessary to translate data into actionable insights. Students learn about some of the latest tools and algorithms being used by corporate and academic machine learning teams (e.g. Google, Uber, Facebook, Udemy, Stitch Fix, Amazon and Apple). Each of the 6 hands-on, project-based modules use real world data from KIVA, a non-profit that connects people through lending to alleviate poverty. Data is powerful, and we believe that anyone can harness it for change.

Data science is a highly interdisciplinary practice, demanding critical thinking, understanding of statistics, and technical coding ability. Irresponsible application of powerful algorithms or an inadequate exploration of underlying assumptions can lead to spurious results. In this course, we emphasize the fundamentals of proper data science and expose students to what is possible using sophisticated machine learning methods. 

Delta Analytics is a 501(c)3 Bay Area non-profit dedicated to bringing rigorous data science to problem-solving, effecting change in nonprofits and the public sector, and making data science an accessible and democratic resource for anyone with the same mission. 

# Curriculum

Topics covered in this course will include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, ensemble approaches, recommendation algorithms, text (NLP) analysis.

Algorithms covered in this course will include linear regression, decision tree, random forest, k-means clustering.

At the end of the course, students will:
1) Have a solid foundational understanding of the statistical and mathematical logic underlying predominant data science methods.
2) Be able to communicate with other data scientists using technical terms about foundational concepts.
3) Write code to clean, process, analyze and visualize real world data from KIVA, a non-profit that connects people through lending to alleviate poverty.

Who: The course is intended for any and all individuals interested in harnessing data towards solving problems in their communities. No prior coding or mathematical/statistical experience is expected, but computer proficiency is necessary.
