    "Module 2:  Feature Engineering\n",
    "======\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Engineering is the process of transforming raw data into features/input variables that are easily digested by algorithms. People think that data scientists often spend most of their time testing out various algorithms; however, the majority of performance gains generally come from well-crafted features. \n",
    "\n",
    "While performing feature engineering, it is critical to keep in mind the question that you are trying to answer.  For the purposes of this exercise, we will be using the KIVA dataset and will be trying to answering the following question:\n",
    "\n",
    "__What drives the loan amount requested by KIVA borrowers?__\n",
    "\n",
    "Our outcome feature is __loan_amount__. In the next notebook, we will formalize this research question as a machine learning task. Our machine learning task will be to predict the loan amount that a borrower requests from KIVA using all the features we explore in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "We may not end up using all the features we create, but the process is an important extension of exploratory analysis. The key difference between feature engineering and exploratory analysis is that we now have a defined question in mind: \"What drives the loan amount requested by KIVA lenders?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will introduce the following types of feature engineering:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Feature pruning\n",
    "1. Time-based features (month, year, etc)\n",
    "1. One-hot encoding to create dummy variables\n",
    "1. Extracting features from strings\n",
    "1. Feature scaling\n",
    "1. Data imputation / cleaning"
